# SampleOperatorOverloading

This sample demonstrates C# operator overloads and value-object behavior using a
small `Money` domain type.

## What You Will Find

- `Money.cs` — a readonly record struct with arithmetic operators, `with`
  expressions, `BigInteger` cents, and currency checks.
- `Currency.cs` — currency enum used by the value object.
- `NoSameMoneyCurrencyException.cs` — domain exception emitted as a TypeScript
  error class.
- `Program.cs` — top-level code that creates money, applies `+=`, and writes the
  result.

This sample is useful for inspecting generated static operator helpers,
exception lowering, `BigInteger` mapping, record-struct output, and arithmetic
expressions.
